## Layout



Space	is	important. Whitespace can de-clutter the app. (Macro white space and micro white space)



Gestalt Theory, principle of proximity: objects that are close to each other on a screen are related to each other



### ~Directing the eye

Arrows and other visual cues are more effective.
Eyes tend to move horizontally or vertically. (from upper left) 
Visual weight: color, size, shape, etc. Try to stick to THREE different levels. 



Techniques: 

- Position, 
- emphasis, 
- contrast,
- most effective: SIZE
- Movement (flow). Three factors that determine direction of visual forces (source: Rudolf Arnheim):
  - visual weight of surrounding elements 
  - shape of objects along their axes
  - visual direction and action of the subject 
  - Perspective/depth, using overlap and size of similar objects http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/pictorial-depth-cues/
- Eyegaze (having an actual human face) 
- Visual cues: arrows, color (contrast), captions, etc. 



### ~Other rules

Light comes from above! 

Design in black and white first

Double your whitespace
